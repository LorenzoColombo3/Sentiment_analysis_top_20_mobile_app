2fa9b2cc-7671-4c41-b1eb-9f3673b300dd,"The ads in this app are horrible and sometimes even cut off the ends of songs, most of the time even run for up to five minutes. On top of the excessive ads you get if you can't scrap up the money for premium, Spotify also doesn't let you have full control over your music if you skip more than three songs if you have the free plan which is unfair due to the poor shuffle feature that doesn't even work half the time.",1

b3072001-b380-4ccf-8888-2ffb5ddfeab1,"It pisses me off that EVERYTHING is paywalled. I understand limited skips, but I can't understand why I can't just click on a song I want to listen to, why I can't listen to an album in order, why they add random songs into my playlists, or why there's an ad after every 3 songs.. it's excessive and gets to a point of unusability. I also feel that they make songs quieter than they should be.. but that could just be my settings. Spotify is far from being the best music app, but it's not the worst.",2

ced0d9fc-e023-4467-9a03-a56e73bdfe96,"I've used this app for 10 years and EVERY UPDATE causes issues and MIGHT fix old ones. Current issues: the ""find playlist"" tool when adding a song to a playlist doesn't work, the whole app has generally slow performance, and it doesn't bring you back to where you last left off a podcast, it instead takes you back to the start + podcast time bar always misses out 10 minutes due to all the ads.

4dd4864b-25bb-436d-a974-a80a68a182bb,so it won't let me listen to the players that I made and is only giving me songs related to the one I just listened to in the playlist and I don't know why so maybe you can try to fix that but I don't have premium so I don't understand why its happening,4
82a399a6-7e72-4ae6-9e4f-2f12a47575cd,It is the worst app if you use it free. It is the best app if you pay. Simple as that.,3
eca2ff13-fd11-4d03-ab83-77eae7da4bc3,"Spotify is an AMAZING APP, if you have premium. Now look, if you have a long Playlist its good without premium, but if you try to play am individual song without it, good luck. If you just want to play a few songs and not a Playlist, I reccomend YouTube music. If you're making a Playlist use Spotify, but be aware that it will add songs and you only get 3 skips without premium. With it, all these dumb things go away.",4

But these constant patch updates and desperate attempts to lure their audiences to buy the premium membership truly shows how cheap Spotify has become. I get it, you want the audiences to buy your membership but at least try not to impose your dominance by snatching away the audience's ability to play the songs of their choice with these stupid play limits. Disappointing AF. 👎🏼",1

4e00dad1-7b28-41bd-b774-6085937e6971,Spotify is the worst app nowadays to listen to music. It doesn't allow the users to play their songs they have to listen to the whole playlist and even after that it doesn't play that song. It only allows the premium users to listen to ads free music download music and play the song in any order you want. Spotify doesn't see the users response instead uses AI. Also pls see everyone's response after 4.11.25 the rating is 1 out of 5. Instead see other apps like YouTube music. It is much better.,1

bd41ab46-b80e-4ff7-bcf0-cbede94562d0,Spotify After the last update the app continues to play after disconnecting a bluetooth headset. Previously when we disconnected a headset the App would pause on its own and not continue playing music. You can imagine i was in the library and i paused my headset to exit and it kept playing causing a distraction in such a quiet place. Please may you fix this. Please.,3

The other day I lost music I had stored to play later when Spotify decided to shorten my list of tunes to play. There's now no way now of recovering the songs I had dug out to listen to. Spotify is a great idea with a lot that still needs to be worked on. They don't pay contributing artists enough and it's an increasingly expensive platform for the general public to make use of.,1

fa42e650-81b7-46f6-b2fc-b3f6df55c27f,The update of the app makes it so irritating that only 6 skips and 6 tap play songs can be listened to We cannot play our favourite album and also they play their recommended song which we do not want to listen to. And if we want to listen to music of our own then they say please buy the premium to play your specified song. Please make it older where 6 skips and tap play are not there otherwise I am changing my music app. I want to give it zero stars but can't give it because of there greed.,1
14c55c2a-f600-45e0-8f2d-5361e8a645ae,It is a brilliant app and most of the songs are available. But it only suggests new and similar type songs using smart shuffle when you play a song from a playlist. Basically smart shuffle is not available when we play an individual song by searching. It would be more help if the smart shuffle was available for individual plays. Otherwise all the things are good with it.,4

I barely memorize the lyrics of a song I love while I know the Spotify ads by heart. I have listened to the ads so much that I can predict what the next ad is gonna be. (I am mostly right.)

b59d221f-0371-4918-be4b-d3b36a68e257,"been using spotify for several years now, and am experiencing the free version because i cant afford it now. This app is one of the worst music streaming services out there, unless you pay for premium of course... you face limitations like being unable to play an album without it shuffling the songs in said album, limited songs you can select to play in one day, and advertisements almost ever other song. Ridiculous. For all the available methods out there, over 10 bucks a month is a little nuts.",2

49766b26-207c-4323-b9b5-47882ae9d753,Spotify is a good music app but.......everything you used to be able to do for free like skip songs or put things in queue you have to have premium and there are way too many ads. Spotify is definitely trenching rn. Not saying the should get rid of premium but at least let us pick your songs in our playlist and put things in queue and get rid of the only six skips an hour,1
bdb0a15e-7fc6-4239-b51a-73a419c3b635,"so I used to really like this app but it got so stupid after a while. you can't even do barely ANYTHING without premium at this point. it's really good on console because you get almost everything but if your on your phone it sucks. you can only skip 6 times an hour, I can't replay a song or mess with where I'm at in the song, you can't listen to your album/ queue in order and can't pick what song you want to listen to after doing it ""too much"" I like how much variety they have but Jesus Christ",2

I swear for 3 updates straight, I haven't been able to like songs but I can add them to playlists. Or it simply can't load my liked songs but can load playlists that are larger than my liked songs. Makes no sense and it gets very annoying.

00a3f2d2-a5eb-41f0-addf-697db672a6f9,This app is just a joke! It keeps on saying that it's not working and each month it says that and also you have to pay for everything to listen to music this is just ridiculous so I'm asking to please fix these issues.,1
7584c441-5594-4645-a743-a23c19c98366,"You asked for a rating so I'm giving you one. The app is pretty bad. The desktop application is pretty good now, but the app is so bad. If you have a large library (>10,000 songs) and try to just press play and shuffle your library, it regularly takes around 5 minutes until the first song starts playing. Then when I try to skip a song, it doesn't play the next song but just sits there showing blank album art for a minute (still playing the last song) then gives up and just shows the song that was already playing. I'll try again and wait for like 60 seconds before it decides to move to the next song. It's not hard to make an app shuffle a lot of songs. Please make this basic functionality work. Spotify is also horrible at playing podcasts, regularly glitching out past a certain length, and forgetting my play position. I gave up and use a separate app for podcasts (which is way better), but spotify now CONSTANTLY tries to force podcasts in my face and ""recommend"" stupid podcasts, which in reality is just shoving ads in my face, for things I don't want, despite me paying for premium, and hundreds of people giving you guys feedback that we want all podcasts hidden or removed automatically (not by manually going into a ""music"" tab). You're even trying to turn yourself into tiktok/youtube and now forcing AUTOPLAYING VIDEO podcasts on my home page when I open the app. I DON'T WANT THIS VIDEO GARBAGE IN MY MUSIC APP I PAY FOR. GET RID OF IT. You don't even give us a setting to hide podcasts, to hide videos, or even to disable autoplay of videos (and the ""workaround"" of enabling the ""low bandwidth"" mode in settings IS NOT A SOLUTION TO THIS). And when I complain to your ""customer support"", it's just an AI chatbot telling me I can disable this and making up a setting that doesn't exist, because that's what LLMs do. They're not actual support. They just make up nonsense then say sorry goodbye. Please listen to your customers (and your paying customers) and stop making stupid decisions and forcing stupid stuff on us. Oh ya, playlist search doesn't really work either (I only have a couple hundred playlists) and there's no search box if you go into a folder. Also it's dumb that when you add a song to a playlist, it shows a green checkmark next to it like you added it to your liked songs. I regularly add a bunch of albums I haven't heard yet into playlists in a ""to listen to"" folder and now I can't tell what I've heard already cuz it looks like it's all saved to my library. I still like you as a service in general and despise apple, I just want you to do better and want to actually enjoy music on my phone effortlessly without all these stupid issues.",2

Plus, when you took away the save changes button and replaced it with the idea of just dismissing the card, I now never know whether or not the song actually did save to all my selected playlists, or just one, or none at all, in spite of the toast saying it saved.

cb4a52fb-8cae-4a60-93d8-72c357c568e4,I don't like the new update. Whenever I want to play one of my playlists instead of starting from the start or top. It just randomly chooses a different song from the playlist which I didn't like since I'm quite used to when the playlist would start playing the first song from the top which is the reason why I had arranged my playlist since I expected for the playlist to go according to my arrangement of songs. So I kindly asked if Spotify removed this update since it was better before.,1

I would have rated it a 5 star review but there is one feature missing. personally I am a big fan of rajasthani songs and the problem with rajasthani songs on Spotify is that they have very long footage of music before the lyrics start. There should be a option to directly skip to the lyrical part of the song or have a option to let the app know where to start the song.,4

61220804-d45b-426f-be62-4f4005e432b3,hi everyone..join Spotify..just 499rupees per year(42rupees per month) for individual premium.in settings i have enabled high quality for audio streaming.due to it video clipping also comes.i hate video clip.i tried to turn off video.but if i chose data saver 'on' video clip(which I hate) becomes invisible(as I liked)..?but I think turning on data saver also reduces audio quality..am i right? Spotify must give separate option to avoid video clip.i hate videos.,3

34075b07-2c94-49f4-ac2c-150370c8f859,"Yeah so, I don't understand why Spotify decided to change the way you can sort and save music. Every time I try to place a song in a specific spot in a playlist, it'll stop scrolling and just drop it wherever. It scrolls so slowly now and it's almost as if it's glitching, but I can't imagine that because these issues started after the last update. Then the way you save music is horrible now since it won't allow you to add the same song to more than one playlist at a time. I'm so done with this.",1

Frequent outages and search failures undermine reliability. Premium users still encounter bugs and ads, undermining trust.

If that feature also get disabled I will definitely changing into another music app. 08/11 -still very restrictive. changed to another app,1

However, I do have 2 bits of critical feedback: 1: whomever thought it was a good idea to force the ""home"" screen to do a full content refresh anytime I give the desktop app focus was just wrong. It just makes users wait for an action they didn't request. 2: if I don't have spotify open on a 2nd device while listening from a 1st device, turns out that's because I don't want it open.

83f463c9-f910-438a-b8c9-f0a4a23909e4,why was the mini premium deal removed? please add it back and please remove the limit for selecting and skipping a song if you dont have premium,1
f451545a-f41e-4761-9278-d32fdce2667a,constant ads in between the song or Playlist played and suddenly i have you limited the skipping or changing the song for just 6 times per day allowed only because of this you guys are going to be most in india.i can tolerate ads atleast as a free user but what that skip songs and please also remove that smart shuffle that is the worst anyone can do other apps do better than you best example is youtube music or I play music on normal youtube rather than having constant control over my song,1

Now the ""Made For You"" playlists just play music I already know and a couple of songs I've not heard from artists I already listen to. It's lost its soul, fun and frankly any differentiator it used to have",1

c55a3dfd-4f1c-41e1-965c-0ca019e6477f,The app has always been awkward to control and use. Lately I've had to force stop it to cast to speakers. It has stopped working with Google routines. In general it has not played nice with Google products. Recently the app has become so slow that it is unusable. This is a sudden change I will need to seek a refund for my subscription. I have tried an uninstall and the issue came back quickly.,1

Though, there are a lot of ads, and you can't pick and choose a song without it being on shuffle mode, it's fairly decent. It will eventually play your song, just maybe not at that moment, and will play a different one that is similar to the song you picked. You can make as many playlists as you want though! {I recommend computer/laptop use because you can pick your songs on demand even if it's free.}",4

7a4f7e1c-bb1e-43b2-b3d0-cfcf7fcc1c29,Is there going to be any effort to fix the issue where many users can't search for the playlists to add songs to? I've already come to terms with the fact that Spotify won't fix me not being able to pick up from where I left off from previous listening sessions. Example: Going to my country playlist when I was last listening to my hip hop playlist a couple hours ago. Long time premium user btw.,3

5b43a4d3-3720-4e93-bb1e-2291ac437147,This app has become horrible after the latest update. After the new update it will not let you play the song which you want to listen instead it will play similar songs to it. Don't know what's the use of a music app which doesn't allow you to listen to a particular song which you want to listen. Forcefully pushing people to purchase the subscription. I have uninstalled finally and am now using Amazon music happily which atleast allows me to play my favorite song. Shame on you Spotify team!,1

Disliked some ads around 10 - 20 times still the same ads were coming. Not at all satisfied. It is solely good for premium users and they don't bloody care for the free users.

e9c8d286-2975-4bf4-b41c-338b263a5e56,The purpose of this review is to present my findings and provide suggestions for the musoicc app spotify. Spotify is one of thhe most used music streaming app which has podcasts and music of many artists over the world.Even though its widely used it has some problems such as there being too many ads which feels like there are ads afer every single song.This is very frustrating many timees as it destroys the focus of many indivisuals.In conclusion it is a good app but they should remove some ads,4
14a7e0e7-6d79-4dc9-bc07-f4d7bcd3aa84,I just dont like this app because after 3 or 4 songs just the ads come of 1 or 2 min and and eyery time it ask for premium if you want to install this app first buy premium and it also says the quality of music also become better but it is fake😭😭🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡,1

If you're not letting me play my favourite songs then atleast play a song from the same playlist or the same artist....why do you switch to a completely different artist and it's not even like you come back after a different song or two you just change everything and play whatever you want.

f9e2d472-a6fe-4541-90ae-54cd85e775c8,"💢 Spotify Review – Not Worth It Without Premium Spotify used to be great, but now the ads are just too much. Every few songs, an ad pops up — sometimes even two or three in a row. It completely ruins the mood when you’re trying to relax or focus. The same ads repeat over and over, which makes it even more annoying. It feels like Spotify is forcing users to buy the Premium plan instead of improving the free experience. Overall, the ad interruptions make it frustrating to use.",1

I have created a playlist that the public can assess, but I can't listen to my playlist or any other creators playlist. without having to listen to other songs that ruin the playlist that I make, so pls Spotify. Make it to where you don't have to have a premium to listen to your playlist. Otherwise, it's a good app except if you haven't previously started a song/book before you go out and don't have internet.",2
